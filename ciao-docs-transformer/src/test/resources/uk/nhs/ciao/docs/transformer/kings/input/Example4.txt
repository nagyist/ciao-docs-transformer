We treated her with antibiotics for urinary tract infection. She was stable during the ward stay but she was not calm and screaming most of the time, but not aggressive and harmful to anyone on ward. However, she became a lot calmer with Quetiapine. She was discharged with Quetiapine low dose.",

  "Past medical history": "Alzheimer's disease, GORD and Total Hip replacement",
  "CoMorbidity": "Alzheimers incl. Dementia in Alzheimers",
  "Laboratory": "CT Chest/Abdo/Pelvis/ +C : Chest: The oesophagus is markedly dilated with evidence of food residue. There are bilateral multifocal airspace opacifications noted within the upper lobes, right middle lobe on a background of bilateral subpleural reticulation. Small right-sided pleural effusion. No evidence of mediastinal or hilar lymph node enlargement. Abdomen: Unremarkable appearances of the liver, biliary tree, pancreas, spleen and the kidneys. No focal abnormality is noted. No evidence of mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymph node enlargement. No evidence of free fluid. Normal appearances of the unprepared small and large bowel. Unremarkable appearances noted within the pelvis and the retroperitoneum. No focal skeletal abnormalities are noted. Conclusion: Abnormal enlargement of the oesophagus with delayed emptying/reflux. Although this may be due to achalasia distal gastro-oesophageal junction lesion cannot be completely excluded. OGD is recommended if this is clinically feasible. The lung parenchymal changes are most likely to be in keeping with recurrent aspiration. No radiological evidence to suggest intra-abdominal or pelvic malignancy.",
